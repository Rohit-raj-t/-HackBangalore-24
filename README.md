# Resolving GitHub Push Protection Error

When pushing changes to a GitHub repository, you may encounter a push rejection due to repository rule violations. One common violation is related to pushing secrets, such as passwords or API keys, to the repository. This guide outlines the steps to resolve such a violation.

## Steps to Resolve the Error

1. **Identify the Secret**:
   - Review the error message to identify the location of the secret in the commit history.
   - Note the file and line number where the secret is detected.

2. **Remove or Update the Secret**:
   - If the secret is no longer needed, consider removing it from the codebase.
   - If the secret is still required, use a secure storage solution or environment variables instead of hardcoding the secret in the code.
   - Update the code to reference the secret from a secure source.

3. **Re-Push the Changes**:
   - After resolving the issue with the secret, commit the changes to your local repository.
   - Push the updated commits to the remote repository using the following command:
     ```bash
     git push origin <branch_name>
     ```
     Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of your branch.

4. **Review Repository Rules**:
   - Take a moment to review the repository rules, especially those related to secrets and sensitive information.
   - Ensure that your workflow complies with these rules to prevent similar issues in the future.
